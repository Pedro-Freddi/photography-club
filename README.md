# Steady Click Photography Club 

This project is part of **Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Path's** challenge projects.

The objective was to build a responsive webpage for a real or fictional club. I decided to create a fictional photography club called Steady Click. All images were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

The webpage is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes (resize the browser to check it out), which was achieved by using Flexbox to layout the gallery section and a media query to make some adjustments for smaller screens.

You can find the live version [here](https://pedro-freddi.github.io/photography-club/).

Thanks for visiting!
