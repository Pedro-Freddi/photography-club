        <p>Welcome to the homepage of the Steady Click (or Stick, how our members call it) Photography Club.
        We are an amateur photography club based in San Diego, California. The club was created by Joe Sternick
        in 2014 after he decided to take his photography hobby to a new level and wanted to have a space in his local 
        community where he could talk to other photography lovers and share his latest pictures.</p>
        <p>Since then, Steady Click's active member list has been <em>steadily</em> (pun intended) growing and we
        currently have over 150 members from all over the United States. Our schedule consists of monthly mettings
        in a local coffee shop in San Diego and weekly online meetings through Zoom. Every member is welcome to
        join the meetings and share their pictures, ask questions about photography, equipment and, mainly,
        have fun and talk to each other.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in joining the Steady Click Photography Club, give us a call or write an e-mail. 
        You can find our contact information at the end of this page.</p>
